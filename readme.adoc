# Spring GraphQL federation interface/union issue

Repo created for the purpose of reporting an issue.

Application fails with the error:

----
Caused by: graphql.schema.idl.errors.SchemaProblem: errors=[There is no type resolver defined for interface / union 'ProductResult' type]
----

However if you disable federation, e.g. by commenting this out then app runs fine:

----
//@Configuration		//comment this out
public class SpringGraphqlFedrationConfiguration {
----
